3. **Multi-step checkout process** with clear progress indicators

## New Checkout Flow

  - Progress indicator (Step 1 of 3)
  - Session storage for checkout state

## Implementation Details

### **Routing Updates**
- **File**: `client/src/App.jsx`
- **Routes Added**:
  - `/shop/checkout/address` - Address selection
  - `/shop/checkout/review` - Order review
  - `/shop/checkout/payment` - Payment processing
  - `/shop/checkout` - Redirects to address selection (legacy support)

### **Cart Navigation Update**
- **File**: `client/src/components/shopping-view/cartWrapper.jsx`
- **Change**: "Proceed to Checkout" now navigates to `/shop/checkout/address`

### **Session Management**
- Uses `sessionStorage` to maintain checkout state between steps
- Stores selected address and shipping calculations
- Automatic cleanup after successful payment

### **Address Auto-Selection Logic**
```javascript
// Auto-select if only 1 address exists
if (addressList && addressList.length === 1 && !selectedAddress) {
  const singleAddress = addressList[0];
  setSelectedAddress(singleAddress);
  toast.success('Address auto-selected');
}
```

### **Progress Indicator**
Visual progress bar showing current step with:
- ✓ Completed steps (green)
- Current step (blue)
- Upcoming steps (gray)
